# Code of Conduct

## Branches 

1. The default branch is `master`. This *has to be* stable and complete.
1. The only commits allowed on `master` branch are *merge commits* from approved Pull Request.
    1. This will be a merge commit from `development` branch in most cases.
    1. The only other merge commits can come from hot fixes.
1. Development happens on `development` branch, with feature branches merged into it.
