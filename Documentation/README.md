# Documentation of the IDS

- [UserManual](UserManual/) contains explanation of the IDS content and how to use it. Start with the [README](UserManual/README.md) file.
- [ImplementersDocumentation](ImplementersDocumentation/) contains additional explanations of the technicalities for software developers, such as how software should handle numeric value [tolerance](ImplementersDocumentation/tolerance.md). The folder also contains a suite of over 250 test file pairs (.ids and .ifc) for verifying the correctness of the software implementation reading and checking capabilities: [TestCases](ImplementersDocumentation/TestCases/).
